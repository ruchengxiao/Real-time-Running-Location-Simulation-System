# Real-time-Running-Location-Simulation-System
This project is a real-time running location simulation and monitoring system under Microservices architecture.<br>
• Implemented server side REST APIs such as running location update service, location distribution service, and location persistence service using Spring Data, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud.
• Persisted data to MongoDB and MySQL using Spring Data as Data Access Layer and incorporated RabbitMQ as message queue to decouple back-end services.
• Deployed applications to embedded Tomcat in automated fashion and used Spring Boot Actuator to monitor and manage application.
• Incorporated Netflix Eureka as service registration and discovery and Spring Boot Actuator to monitor application health.
• Developed the single page front-end to integrate with back-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST and WebSocket.
